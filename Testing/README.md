# Testing

This area will be used to discuss the various methods of testing for the Dialktor project.

## Unit tests
We currently have two unit tests that will check file encryption and file upload/download to Google storage
These test can be ran `python manage.py test`

## System tests
We have not yet developed system tests

## Acceptance tests
Our acceptance tests are simple.
1.) Can the user create a user name and login, or just log in?
2.) Can the user record, store, and listen to any stored audio files?
3.) Can the user create collections to organize their recordings?
4.) Can the user logout?
